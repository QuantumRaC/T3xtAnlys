Key Statistical Features:

1. **Sentence Length (words):**
   - Average: {avg_sentence_length}
   - Standard Deviation: {std_sentence_length}
   - Range: {range_sentence_length}
   - Oscillation Ratio: {osc_sentence_length:.1%}

2. **Token Length (characters):**
   - Average: {avg_token_length}
   - Standard Deviation: {std_token_length}
   - Range: {range_token_length}
   - Oscillation Ratio: {osc_token_length:.1%}

3. **Clauses per Sentence:**
   - Average: {avg_clauses_per_sentence}
   - Standard Deviation: {std_clauses_per_sentence}
   - Range: {range_clauses_per_sentence}
   - Oscillation Ratio: {osc_clauses_per_sentence:.1%}

Additional Linguistic Features:

- Part of Speech Distribution: {pos_freq}
- Dependency Distribution: {dep_freq}
- Verb Tense Distribution: {verb_tense_freq}
- Most Frequent Lemmas: {lemma_freq}
- Morphological Patterns (first 2 sentences): {morphs_sample}

Task for you:
- Based on these data points, describe the text's **writing style, tone, pacing, and syntactic complexity**.
- Comment on whether the style appears **formal or informal, complex or simple, dynamic or static**, and any **patterns or motifs** suggested by word or structure repetition.
- Use accessible language for a general reader, but feel free to use stylistic terminology where appropriate.
