You are an expert in literary style, rhetorical writing techniques, and computational linguistics.

Your task is to analyze the following text and generate a clear, reader-friendly description of its **style, tone, pacing, and presentation**. Focus on **how the writer achieves these effects** through choices in **sentence structure, word choice, rhythm, and repetition**.

Imagine you are explaining to someone **how to write in this style** or **how this style shapes the reader's experience**.



Linguistic Clues (for your reference—not for mechanical reporting):

- **Sentence Length (words):**
  - Average: {avg_sentence_length}
  - Standard Deviation: {std_sentence_length}
  - Range: {range_sentence_length}
  - Oscillation Ratio: {osc_sentence_length:.1%}

- **Token Length (characters):**
  - Average: {avg_token_length}
  - Standard Deviation: {std_token_length}
  - Range: {range_token_length}
  - Oscillation Ratio: {osc_token_length:.1%}

- **Clauses per Sentence:**
  - Average: {avg_clauses_per_sentence}
  - Standard Deviation: {std_clauses_per_sentence}
  - Range: {range_clauses_per_sentence}
  - Oscillation Ratio: {osc_clauses_per_sentence:.1%}

- **Part of Speech Distribution:** {pos_freq}
- **Dependency Distribution:** {dep_freq}
- **Verb Tense Distribution:** {verb_tense_freq}
- **Most Frequent Lemmas:** {lemma_freq}
- **Morphological Patterns (first 2 sentences):** {morphs_sample}

In your response, address the following:

1. **Overall Style & Tone:**
   - Is it formal, informal, poetic, journalistic, reflective, conversational, etc.?

2. **Writing Techniques & Effects:**
   - What sentence structures, rhythms, or patterns shape the pacing and mood?
   - What choices in wording or repetition contribute to emphasis, emotion, or theme?

3. **Guidance for Imitation:**
   - If someone wanted to write in this style, what specific techniques should they use? (e.g., long sentences, vivid verbs, repetitive phrasing, etc.)

Important Guidelines:
- Use the provided data as **background insights** to inform your analysis—do not simply report the numbers.
- Focus on explaining **how specific writing choices create specific effects** on the reader.
- Avoid vague statements—ground your insights in observable patterns from the text and linguistic clues.
- Limit your output to below 200 words.
